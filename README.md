Hello!!

This is the "Role 4 Initiative" readme file! 

Please read through the entire file before making 
any additions/modifications to the project as there
are several conventions that MUST be followed.

//--------------------------CONVENTIONS---------------------------------------//

DJANGO - This website is written in the django framework. If you are unfamiliar
with it, please do not proceed until you are. The documentation and 
tutorials can be found at https://docs.djangoproject.com/
We use django 1.7 for development. Please make sure you are using this
version as there are subtle differences in the way they handle databases.

MYSQL - This website uses a debian version of mySQL made for crunchbang linux.
Django should be able to handle all of the database work, so don't worry too much
about it. If you need to do hard coded database queries, consult the repository owner first.
Documentation for mySQL can be found at http://www.mysql.com/

PEP8 - All python code should follow pep8 conventions. Documentation can be found
at http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

HTML - All html code MUST be validated. No exceptions. Conventions are decided by
w3c. documentation can be found at http://www.w3.org/ and the html5 validator can
be found at http://validator.w3.org/

CSS - For now, we will use bootstrap for formatting the markup. Documentation can
be found at http://getbootstrap.com/

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//

//---------------------------TASKS--------------------------------------------//

This website is far from complete and there are several tasks that must be
completed before we can launch. The tasks will be presented in a list below.
As they are completed, please stamp them with your name and date/time of
completion as shown in the following format.

	-taskname - completed - name - dd/mm/yyyy - hh:mm am/pm
Example:
	-dice rolling script - completed - konstantin - 06/28/2014 - 12:06 am

	
	TASKS:
	
	-dice rolling script
	-login form
	-new user form
	-split homepage up into tabs
	-database queries for user info
	-design character sheets
	-design group pages (talk to repository owner)

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//

//---------------------------DUSTIN-------------------------------------------//

For now, just work on the dice rolling script and let me know when it's done.
If you finish and want some more to do, look over the django framework to get 
a feel for how things are arranged. Also look into PuTTY for windows. I may
eventually set up an SSH for you so you can work on a linux environment and
do webpage testing (depending on how far you'd like to go with this)
